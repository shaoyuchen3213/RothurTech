1. JDBC
    Step: Connection -> statement -> sql query -> process sql -> close connection
    select update, insert(whole, partial), delete
    Atomic transaction  (commit, rollback)
    PreparedStatement, Statement
    BatchProcessing


    sql injection
    abc@gmail submit
    select * from order_table where email = 'abc@gmail.com'

    PreparedStatement -> sql injection

    Satatement(regular statement), PreparedStatement (Statement with parameter), CallableStatement

 1. Hibernate
    ORM -> Object relational mapping
    tool: Hibernate, Sequelize, Mybatis

    JPA: Java presistence API specification
    Hibernate is a implementation of javaEE

    Hibernate Architecture
    need to setup hibernate.cfg.xml, and set property in here
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    Entity LifeCycle
        Transient
        Persistent: The entity object mantains by the session
        Detached: break object and session, so the object in detached state
        Removed: previous object connect to session and session connect to database, and when we remove the object, the data in database will also be removed


    Mapping
        OneToOne  Husband <-> Wife
        ManyToOne
        OneToMany  Employee -> Account
        ManyToMany   Reader <-> Subscrption

    Cascade Type
        Persist
        Merge : update database with new entity
        Refresh: updated the object with current row in database
        Remove
        Detach
        All

    Fetch type
        Lazy loading
        Eager Loading

        OneToOne: eager
        ManyToOne: eager
        OneToMany: Lazy
        ManyToMany: Lazy

    First level cache/ Second level cache
    Session level cache
        open by default
        first level
    Session factory Level Cache
        close by default
        global
        second level

    query data from hibernate
    criteria Queries
    Hibernate query language
    Native query
