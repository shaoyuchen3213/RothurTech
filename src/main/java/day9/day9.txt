Spring code - > Spring MVC -> Spring Boot

we need to set up servlets by ourself, and xml file
Spring MVC  we only setup dispatch servlet
Spring Boot it has tomcat set up for us

Spring MVC
    -Model  -> View  -> Control
    send request to dispatchServlet, then dispatchServlet send to handler mapping, controller, and controller send back the model and view to dispatcherServlet
    then dispatcherServlet sent it to view resolver. Then sent to view
Spring Boot
    why? The advantage has auto-configuration, handle all dependencies problem, need starter-validation dependency
       embedded server -> Tomcat(default server)
       it is annotation based
       web-start
       test-starter
 Rest API design
    filter: get   /tickets?state=close
    sorting: get /tickets?sort=priority, created_at
    search:  get   /ticket?q=java

 Spring Boot rest
    @RequestBody: Transfer Json to java object
    @ReponseBody: Transfer Java Object to Json
    @Controller vs @RestController   -> controller + responsebody
    @GetMapping: is used to map HTTP GET request
    @PutMappingï¼š is used to map HTTP update request
    @PostMapping: is used to post quest
    @RequestMapping: is used to request to get speific data.
    @PathVariable:  used to extract values from the URI (or URL path) of the request
    @RequestParam:is used to extract query parameters from the request URL.
